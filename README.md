This project presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning strategy in a racing setting, with three types of agents controlling the race car's motor and steering actions: DDPG, DDQN, and DQN. The agents use sensory inputs like LiDAR, location, velocity, and acceleration to simulate realistic driving dynamics. The idea is for agents to learn and adapt by competing against one another and interacting with their environment. Training enhances performance, and the problems of multi-agent systems, such as communication and environmental dynamics, are investigated.
