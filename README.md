This project explores a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for racing, where three types of agents (DDPG, DDQN and DQN) control a race carâ€™s motor and steering. These agents rely on sensory inputs like LiDAR, location, velocity, and acceleration to navigate the environment realistically. The goal is for them to learn and adapt by competing and interaction with each other. Through training, they refine their performance, and the challenges of multi-agent systems (communication, complex environmental dynamics, etc.) are analyzed along the way.
